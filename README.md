## Prerequisit

Download and place excecutable from [this repository](https://github.com/cognidox/OfficeToPDF) into your path

## Improvements
Currently this tool just checks if there is already a file with the .pdf extention and the same name as the office document. Later there should be implemented a check if the office document has been edited after the creation date of the pdf.
